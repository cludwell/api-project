scarebnb is a spoof of airbnb with a theme of haunted locations. The airbnb  logo has looked like a planchette to me, the part of a ouija board that the players guide. Keeping the theme while also trying to be work appropriate was quite a challenge, as there were many haunted locations that I wanted to include but the backstories were just to grisly.

Technologies used include,
-csrf
-express js
-React js
-Redux
In addition to various other npm packages

To launch the app locally, cd into the authenticate-me directory. Create two terminals. Cd one into the back end folder and enter npm start in the terminal. The other should cd into the frontend directory, enter npm start into that terminal as well. The app should now open in your default internet browser.

The database scheme looks like this

![project-schema]
[project-schema]: ./images/airbnb_dbdiagram.png

The shape of the redux store is located in the ./storeshape.js file.

The majority of the store looks like this

const store = {
  session: {},
  spots: {
    allSpots: {
      [spotId]: {
        spotData,
      },
    },
    currentUser: {
      [spotId]: {
        spotData,
      },
    },
    singleSpot: {
      spotData,
      SpotImages: [imagesData],
      Owner: {
        ownerData,
      },
    },
  },
}

Feature Checklist follows


Mod 5 AirBnB Feature Checklist

You will be assessed on the completion of the "Acceptance Criteria" list in every feature. Your goal is to complete 100% of all the "Acceptance Criteria" checklists below.

The "User Stories" list in every feature is a list of business needs or user expectations of the feature. They are written in the typical language of defining user expectations of a software development product.
Feature: Landing Page - List of All Spots
User Stories

    As a site visitor or authenticated user, I want to see a list of spots offered for rent with a thumbnail image, location, and price.

Acceptance Criteria

    On the landing page of the site, I should see a tile list of all the spots.
    Each spot tile in the tile list should have a thumbnail image, the city, and the state of the spot.
    Each spot tile in the tile list should have a tooltip with the the name of the spot as the tooltip's text.
    Each spot tile in the tile list should have a star rating of "New" (if there are no review for that spot) or the average star rating of the spot as a decimal.
    Each spot tile in the tile list should have the price for the spot followed by the label "night".
    Clicking any part of the spot tile should navigate to that spot's detail page.

Feature: View Spot Details
User Stories

    As a site visitor or authenticated user, I want to see a minimum of 1 image (preview image) on the spot's details page with:
        The location, with the country
        1-5 spot images
        The host's name
        A description
        The price
    NOTE: Ratings and reviews will be covered in a separate feature.

Acceptance Criteria

    On the spot's detail page, the following information should be present: a Heading <spot name>, Location: <city>, <state>, <country>, Images (1 large image and 4 small images), Text: Hosted by <first name>, <last name>, Paragraph: <description>, and the callout information box on the right, below the images.
    The callout information box on the right of the spot's detail page should state the price for the spot followed by the label "night", and have a "Reserve" button.
    When the "Reserve" button on the spot's detail page is clicked, it should open an alert with the text "Feature coming soon".

Feature: View Rating and Reviews
User Stories

    As a site visitor or authenticated user, when viewing the home page, I want to see the rating of each spot (average rounded to 1 decimal place).
    As a site visitor or authenticated user, when viewing a spot's details, I want to see the reviews posted for that spot. Starting with the most recent.
    As an authenticated user, if there are no reviews yet, I should see a prompt encouraging me to leave the first review.
    As a site visitor or authenticated user, I want to see the average rating for the spot rounded to the nearest single decimal place, followed by the number of reviews posted for that spot.

Acceptance Criteria

    When viewing the home page, each spot tile in the tile list must show the average star rating for that spot immediately below the thumbnail of the tile and to the right of the spot's name. The average star rating should have a star icon followed by the average star rating of all the reviews for that spot as a decimal (e.g. 3.0 or 4.89, NOT 3 or 5).
    When viewing a spot's detail page, the review summary info should be in two different places, the callout information box and the heading before the list of reviews. The review summary info should show the average star rating of all the reviews for that spot and the review count for that spot.
    The average star rating in the spot's detail page should have a star icon followed by the average star rating of all the reviews for that spot as a decimal (e.g. 3.0 or 4.89, NOT 3 or 5).
    If there are no reviews for the spot, the text, "New", should be next to the star icon instead.
    The review count on the spot's detail page should be an integer representing the total number of reviews for that spot followed by the text "Reviews" (e.g. "4 Reviews").
    If the review count is 1, it should show "1 Review" (not "1 Reviews").
    There should be a centered dot (Â·) between the star rating and the review count
    If the review count is zero (there are no reviews yet for this spot), it should not show the centered dot or the review count (only the average star rating should be displayed)

    Each review in the review list must include: The reviewer's first name, the month and the year that the review was posted (e.g. December 2022), and the review comment text.
    If no reviews have been posted yet and the current user is logged-in and is NOT the owner of the spot, replace the reviews list with the text "Be the first to post a review!"

Feature: Create a New Spot
User Stories

    As an authenticated user, I want to create a spot to include in the listings.
    As an authenticated user, if I make a mistake while creating a spot, I want useful error messages (a.k.a. validation).
    As an authenticated user, when I successfully create a spot, I want to see its details immediately.

Acceptance Criteria

    There should be a "Create a New Spot" button in the navigation bar to the left of the User Menu button for logged-in users.
    Upon clicking the "Create a New Spot" button, the user should be navigated to a blank form to gather the data for a new spot (see wireframe).
    On the new spot form, there should be: a title at the top with the text "Create a New Spot".
    The first section should include: a heading of "Where's your place located?", a caption of "Guests will only get your exact address once they booked a reservation.", and text inputs with labels and placeholders for "Country", "Street Address", "City", and "State" ("Latitude" and "Longitude" inputs are optional for MVP)
    The second section should include: a heading of "Describe your place to guests", a caption of "Mention the best features of your space, any special amentities like fast wifi or parking, and what you love about the neighborhood.", and a text area with a placeholder of "Please write at least 30 characters".
    The third section should include: a heading of "Create a title for your spot", a caption of "Catch guests' attention with a spot title that highlights what makes your place special.", and a text input with a placeholder of "Name of your spot".
    The fourth section should include: a heading of "Set a base price for your spot", a caption of "Competitive pricing can help your listing stand out and rank higher in search results.", and a number input with a placeholder of "Price per night (USD)".
    The fifth section should include: a heading of "Liven up your spot with photos", a caption of "Submit a link to at least one photo to publish your spot.", and five text inputs where the first input has a placeholder of "Preview Image URL" and the rest of the inputs have a placeholder of "Image URL".
    The submit button should have the text of "Create Spot".
    Validation messages must show at the top of the form or under each field with an error if the user tries to submit an incomplete form. Examples: a Required Field: " is required" (e.g. "Price per night is required", etc.), a Description Min Length: "Description needs 30 or more characters". Out of the five image URL inputs, only the first Image URL input (the Preview Image URL) is required.
    When a spot is successfully created, the user should automatically be navigated to the new spot's detail page.
    Navigating away and back to the create spot form form resets any errors and clears all data entered, so it displays in the default state (no errors, empty inputs, button disabled).

Feature: Post a Review
User Stories

    As an authenticated user, when posting a review, I want to set a star rating from 1 to 5.

Acceptance Criteria

    If the current user is logged-in and they are viewing a spot's detail page for a spot that they HAVE NOT posted a review yet, a "Post Your Review" button shows between the rating/reviews heading and the list of reviews.
    If the current user is logged-in and they are viewing a spot's detail page for a spot that they are an owner of, the "Post Your Review" button should be hidden.
    If the current user is logged-in and they are viewing a spot's detail page for a spot that they HAVE posted a review for, the "Post Your Review" button should be hidden.

    There should be a star rating input ranging from 1 to 5 stars followed by a label of "Stars".
    The submit button should have the text of "Submit Your Review".
    The "Submit Your Review" button is disabled when there are fewer than 10 characters in the comment text area and when the star rating input has no stars selected.
    If a server error occurs, show it below the title. (But that shouldn't happen under normal circumstances).
    When the review is successfully created, the newly created review should show up at the bottom of the reviews list.
    When the review is successfully created, the average star rating and review summary info should be updated in both places.
